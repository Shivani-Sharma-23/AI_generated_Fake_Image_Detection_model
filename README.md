# AI-Generated Fake Image Detection

## Overview

This repository hosts an AI model and toolkit for the detection of fake or manipulated images generated by AI algorithms. With the proliferation of deepfake technology and the potential for misuse, it's crucial to develop reliable tools for identifying such content.

My goal is to provide a state-of-the-art solution for detecting AI-generated fake images. This project incorporates cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning techniques to classify images as genuine or manipulated.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: I have developed a deep learning model capable of identifying AI-generated fake images based on various visual cues and artifacts.

- **Pre-trained Weights**: I provide pre-trained model weights for easy use, but also offer the option to fine-tune the model on custom datasets.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Explore my Jupyter notebooks for in-depth tutorials and analysis of the model's performance.

- **Data Augmentation Tools**: I include data augmentation scripts to help you create a diverse dataset for training and testing.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Follow our step-by-step instructions in the documentation to get started with model training and inference.

## Model Performance
